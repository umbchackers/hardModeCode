## Fizz Buzz
Write a function that takes a number (from one to infinity) and returns either a number or a string. For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.

**Function Header:**
```javascript
function fizz_buzz(n) {}

**Examples:**
> fizz_buzz(5) == "Buzz"  
> fizz_buzz(7) == 7  
> fizz_buzz(15) == "FizzBuzz"  
> fizz_buzz(18) == "Fizz"
