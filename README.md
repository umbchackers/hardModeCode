# hardModeCode
A user-hostile environment meant to test your coding precision and prowess as you complete coding challenges, all without being able to edit your code once you type it.

## Vision
This would be a competitive programming event where multiple users would connect to the server hosted on someone's computer as the master. The players would all be doing the same problems at the same time to compete to be the fastest and use the least resets while coding.

## To Run
> npm install  
> node server.js

## TODO
- Duplicate Filename Resolution
- Add Python and C++ support
- Problem code hightlighting?
- Run on Docker container for security
